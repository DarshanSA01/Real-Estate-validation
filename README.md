Real Estate Validation: Accurate Property Assessment with Ensemble Regression Models
This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced machine learning techniques,
specifically regression and ensemble methods. The dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices:
Advanced Regression Techniques" includes 80 features representing property attributes such as size,
location, and quality. The goal is to develop a model that not only predicts house prices accurately but
also uncovers the underlying factors driving these prices. The approach integrates feature engineering,
exploratory data analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques like Ridge, Lasso, Gradient
Boosting, and LightGBM
